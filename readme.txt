This mod mutes the background music in A Link Between Worlds. It is 100% compatible with all different versions and regions of A Link Between Worlds, and it does not require patching a rom file. 

To install this mod on a 3DS console, put the romfs folder into /luma/titles/00040000000EC300 on your console's SD card. To install this mod on the Citra emulator, put the romfs folder into user\load\mods\00040000000EC300. (Note that the 00040000000EC300 folder mentioned in the above example is for the USA 1.0 version of the game, so be sure to put the .bcsar file into the correct folder for your version of ALBW.)

This mod mutes ALL of the BGM, but get-item jingles have been kept in to maintain the character of the game.
